# Kristik-Saga-3-v2

Internal project and redesign of the Kristik Saga Visual Novel game, now released to the public.
Assets included. Push to master instead of main branch. 

# About
This project initially was created in 2020, but was abandoned after a couple months. Soon after, a revival of Kristik Saga 3 was underway, hence this project.

The game was initially going to be closed source with a protected Enigma Protector project associated with it, but seeing as how this game is not being sold commercially, this project is now open source.

Enigma Protector v7.30+ and Ren'Py 7.4.11+ is required to utilize the game's assets as intended.
